# Analysis-on-Student-Data
This project focuses on predicting student academic performance using various machine learning classification algorithms.
The goal is to identify whether a student is a High Performer based on academic, behavioral, and AI-usage related factors.

The project applies end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, manual evaluation, and comparison of multiple algorithms.
